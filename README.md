# 🍎 Fruit Checker Game (using Python sets)

A fun console game where you enter the fruits you ate, and the program tells you:

- Which fruits you ate that were actually in your fridge
- Which fruits you claimed, but didn't have
- What fruits are still left in your fridge

## ▶️ Run the game

```bash
python3 fruit_checker_set.py

Example
🍽️ Enter the fruits you ate (comma-separated): banana, kiwi, cherry
😋 You ate these from your fridge: {'banana', 'kiwi'}
🤔 These fruits were NOT in your fridge: {'cherry'}
🍏 Fruits left in the fridge: {'orange', 'grapes', 'apple'}
